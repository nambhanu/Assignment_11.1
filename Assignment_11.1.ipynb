    "<p><strong>a) By using a lot of data:</strong> By using a lot of data overfitting can be avoided, overfitting happens relatively as we have a small dataset, and we try to learn from it.</p>\n",
    "<p><strong>b) By using cross validation:</strong> If we have a small database and we are forced to come with a model based on that. In such situation, we can use a technique known as cross validation. In this method the dataset splits into two section, testing and training datasets, the testing dataset will only test the model while, in training dataset, the datapoints will come up with the model.</p>"
